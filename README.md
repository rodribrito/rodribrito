- 👋 Hi, I’m @rodribrito
- 👀 I’m interested in the fields of mathematical modelling of physical systems (mainly thermal and fluids) and in software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently deep-diving in C++ advanced topics and software architecture subjects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulation software projects that involve multiple disciplines, even beyond physics (e.g., biology, economics, etc.)
- 📫 You can reach me at rodribrito@protonmail.com
